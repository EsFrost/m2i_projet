frontpage:

takes 20-30 random pictures from photo table and displays them to homepage

storage:

when a user uploads a photo it automatically creates a folder with the user name which has a folder with the year -> and finally month
photos have the date they were uploaded, the user's name and a random string as name

For the love of god finish the fucking UI (signin/signup/signout for example!)
