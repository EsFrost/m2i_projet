frontpage:

takes 20-30 random pictures from photo table and displays them to homepage

storage:

when a user uploads a photo it automatically creates a folder with the user name which has a folder with the year -> and finally month
photos have the date they were uploaded, the user's name and a random string as name

For the love of god finish the fucking UI (signin/signup/signout for example!)
AND WRITE THE DAMN SPECS


! the text of the hero is off center when in mobile view
! on mobile images have to be slightly bigger or remove padding so there is less white space
! footer on mobile view can have the two areas next to other to save space
