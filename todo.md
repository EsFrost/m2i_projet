# Backend

- Do a review of the whole codebase
- Create the database again and test all routes
- Write the documentation
- Add RETURNING (valuen...) || \* where needed

## Categories controller

- createCategory should be admin only

## Downloads controller

- checkDownloads and showUserDownloads need to be checked, they seem like duplicates

## Check if all controllers and functions are validated
